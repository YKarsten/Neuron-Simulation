# Neuron-Simulation

This project explores various computational models of neuronal stimulation, culminating in an algorithm designed for the stimulation of current cochlear implants.  
Originally developed in Matlab for a master's program in Neuroscience, the project has been reimagined in Python and formatted into a Jupyter lab notebook for enhanced readability. This transition not only showcases my scientific background but also reflects my approach to working with data and visualization. For a more in-depth understanding of the underlying mathematical and neurobiological details, refer to [my written report](Neuroprothetics-report-Y-Karsten.pdf).

## To get started open the .ipynb file on github and consult the .pdf file for more details

# Installation

You can view a rendered version of the notebook [here](Neuron-Simulation.ipynb).

### Prerequisites
- **Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Jupyter Lab:** Install Jupyter Lab using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter lab
- **External Libraries:** Use `pip install` for library installation.
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib ipywidgets scipy

### Steps  
1. **Download:** Download the Jupyter notebook file [Neuron-Simulation.ipynb](Neuron-Simulation.ipynb) from this repository to your local machine.

2. **Run Jupyter Lab Server:**
  - Open a terminal or command prompt.
  - Navigate to the directory where you saved the notebook file.
  - Run the following command:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab

3. **Access the notebook:**
  - Open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal.
  - Navigate to the notebook file and click on it to open.
    
4. **Interact with the Notebook:**
  - Execute code cells using the "Run" button or by pressing Shift + Enter.

# Usage
It is recommended to `Run all cells` as this ensures all cells to execute properly. The project is seperated into different models that can be run seperately, but within a model some calculations require the execution of preceeding cells.

# Structure
1. **Neuron-Simulation.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the computational models of neuronal stimulation and cochlear implant algorithms.

2. **Neuroprothetics-report-Y-Karsten.pdf:** Written report providing a more in-depth understanding of the underlying mathematical and neurobiological details.

3. **README.md:** Instructions on how to get started, install dependencies, and use the Jupyter notebook.
