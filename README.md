# Neuron-Simulation

This project was originally written in Matlab for a class in my masters programm in Neuroscience.
I rewrote it to python and fit it into a Juypter notebook for ease of readability.

Its a way to show my scientific background and my way of working with data and visualisation.

For a more detailed background on the underlying mathematical and neurobiological details you can consult my written report at [Neuroprothetics-report-Y-Karsten.pdf]
